Something strange happened with my ssh key on a server where it all was saved and I've lost all progress I had there that was not saved on Github.

Luckily, all lost progress amounted to one post describing that I've added Bootstrap, which I'm replacing now.

Bootstrap is pretty cool - people who do front-end way better than me have compiled and offered lots of tools that make front-end easier. Even without cool template, it made the site look better. I'll have to get myself familiar with tools it offers.

Abstraction that was used is now stretched way too much but the code still works and I'm planning to move to Flask anyway.
